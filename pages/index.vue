          Hi, I'm Longyu Zhu. Nice to meet you!
        </h1>
        <h2>
          I'm a software engineer and a full-stack web developer.
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am passionate about developing <strong>web applications</strong> and solving <strong>challenging
            problems</strong>.
          With expertise in <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, and
          <strong>Express</strong>,
          I build user-friendly and efficient solutions. I also have experience with <strong>Python frameworks</strong>
          like Django and Flask,
          enabling me to create robust back-end systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, at <strong>Kong Climbing</strong>, an indoor climbing gym startup in Toronto, I contributed to
          building a
          <strong>digital platform</strong> for memberships, schedules, and bookings, streamlining operations and
          improving the user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond work, I enjoy <strong>photography</strong>, <strong>cooking</strong>, and <strong>fitness</strong>
          activities like
          running and badminton. I thrive on collaboration and enjoy connecting with others through <strong>social
            activities</strong>
          and shared experiences.
